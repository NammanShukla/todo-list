## A Basic To-Do List Application

### Task 1 

To initiate the basic application, assuming the *No Frameworks yet* rule applies. The application should take input which will **add** a new task to the list, the said task can be **deleted** and **edited** by the user. When the task is **completed** it is crossed out entirely. The list should have a To-do and Status field and an ID element which is uniquely assigned to each task.
