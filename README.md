## A Basic To-Do List Application

### Task 1 

To initiate the basic application, assuming the *No Frameworks yet* rule applies. The application should take input which will **add** a new task to the list, the said task can be **deleted** and **edited** by the user. When the task is **completed** it is crossed out entirely. The list should have a To-do and Status field and an ID element which is uniquely assigned to each task. 

### Task 2 

This feature is a simple search bar where the input is used to filter the list that is made by the user. Additionally, searching for "completed" or "pending". 
I also added a status bar which will help tell the how many tasks are completed, how many are left and how many in total.
